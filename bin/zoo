# MY ACTUAL PROGRAM THE THING USERS INTERACT WITH

# How do we load the file in lib/cat.rb?
# require_relative
# require
  # - it seems to look at directories that are in your $LOAD_PATH -

# load
# $LOAD_PATH << "/Users/avi/loading-files-ruby/lib"

# require does not work with relative paths because your current directory is not in your $LOAD_PATH

# require '../lib/cat' # because one, bin/zoo, so it should ../lib/cat - this is still relative...
# require '/Users/avi/loading-files-ruby/lib/cat' # . the current directory
# require '/Users/avi/loading-files-ruby/lib/bin/lib/cat' # . the current directory
# require './lib/cat' # . the current directory
# require_relative '../lib/cat'


# Load my environment - the files I need to make this program work
require_relative '../config/environment'

# main scope

puts ANIMALS

cat = Cat.new
fido = Dog.new
cow = Cow.new
bear = Bear.new
puts "I am #{cat.object_id}"
puts "I am #{fido.object_id}"
puts "I am #{cow.object_id}"
puts "I am #{bear.object_id}"

# Rules of Thumb
# Don't alter $LOAD_PATH
# Use require to load gems only.

# just use the require_all
